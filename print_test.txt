greenbar print test line 1
new greenbar print line
another greenbar line to print
line 4 for greenbar printing
yet another greenbar line
more greenbar printing
ok, one more line then
two more lines now
hello from cat
this is live greenbar printing
I have cat constantly feeding this file
redirecting into print_test.txt
It's like a poor mans messenger app
updates just happen
greenbar is very suited to this kind of output
piping 'ls' commands didn't really work
I'd need to do more research into how to make it work better
this very retro looking
just like an old crt screen from a by-gone era
hello there
this is a new line
I am finding great new commands
very interesting
the greenbar lines alternate
end of transmittion
good-bye
ok, I'm back
I have so much more to relay
while true, do this
